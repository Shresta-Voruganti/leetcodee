The line,

```java
start = s.indexOf(word, start + 1);
```

### What does it do?

* `s.indexOf(word, start + 1)` is used to find the **next occurrence** of the substring `word` in the string `s`, starting from the index `start + 1`.
* This allows you to search for multiple occurrences of the same word in the string by updating the `start` position after each match.

### How it works in the code:

* Initially, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `word` in `s`.
* Then, after processing that occurrence (marking all the relevant positions as `true` in the `bold` array), the code updates `start` to `start + 1`, which ensures that the next search for `word` will start from the next position in the string.
* This continues until `indexOf()` returns `-1`, meaning no more occurrences of the word are found.

### Example:

Let's say `s = "abcabcabc"` and `word = "abc"`.

1. `start = s.indexOf("abc")` will give `start = 0`.
2. The loop will mark positions `0, 1, 2` as `true` in the `bold` array.
3. Then, `start = s.indexOf("abc", 1)` will find the next occurrence of `"abc"` starting from index `1`, so `start` will be updated to `3`.
4. The loop will mark positions `3, 4, 5` as `true`.
5. Then, `start = s.indexOf("abc", 4)` will find the next occurrence starting from index `4`, and the process repeats.

This ensures that **all occurrences** of the word are processed without missing any.
